# How to use DXGrid in Server Mode with XPO


<p>This is a simple example of GridControl bound to <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#XPO/clsDevExpressXpoXPServerCollectionSourcetopic">XPServerCollectionSource</a>. You should restore the NorthwindXpo database from the backup file on your SQL Server prior to running the sample. When the grid works in Server Mode, filtering, sorting, grouping and summation is performed at the database server level. SQL queries generated by <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/xpo">XPO</a> are displayed in a text box under the grid.</p><p><strong>See also:</strong><br />
